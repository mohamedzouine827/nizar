Nizar Abdelkarim 20 years old, Passionate about photography/videography and editing, during the years I found that I can express my self and my ideas using camera and anything visual that I can work on with feelings so I can see the results trough the display. I worked with so many clubs in my university editing and filming videos also photographing some events.
My main work right now is making my own documentaries and Filmmaking also working with some clients for photoshoot or videos and editing for there projects
